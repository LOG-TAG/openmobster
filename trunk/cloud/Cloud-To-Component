Cloud Side
------------------

PushRPC is the service that is invoked. PushRPC uses the Notifier/Notification stack to 
communicate to the CometSession layer.

There is a Comet Session for each registered device. It is active when it is connected to the device.

PushRPC sends a Push Invocation for a device side component via the Comet Session


Device Side
------------------

On the deviceside CommandProcessor receives it and broadcats the request using PushRPCInvocationHandler.

This is regitered via the Moblet kernel into the Apps but not the CloudManager.

Upon receipt, if the target component is registered via moblet-app.xml, the invocation is delivered.
