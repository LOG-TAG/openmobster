### Sending a Push Notification ###
You can send a push notification from the cloud using the Push API. This API is located on the **org.openmobster.cloud.api.push.PushService** object.

On this object you use the following method
```
       /**
	 * A device agnostic Push method. Push is associated with the user and not his operating system
	 * 
	 * @param identity user that must receive this message
	 * @param appId unique application id this push is associated with
	 * @param message message to be sent
	 * @param title title of the message
	 * @param details any other details associated with the message
	 */
	public void push(String identity, String appId, String message, String title, String details)
```

### Setup Push Notification in your App ###

You can setup **Push Notification** support in your app via two configuration files. Before we go into those details you must understand that there are two types of push notifications. **User Initiated Push notification** using the PushService API, and **Sync Initiated Push Notification** which is generated by the Sync Engine.

#### AndroidManifest.xml ####
```
<receiver android:name="org.openmobster.core.mobileCloud.api.ui.framework.push.PushBroadcastReceiver">
    		<intent-filter>
    			<action android:name="org.crud.android.app"/>
    		</intent-filter>
    	</receiver>
    	
    	<receiver android:name="org.openmobster.core.mobileCloud.api.ui.framework.push.SyncPushBroadcastReceiver">
    		<intent-filter>
    			<action android:name="org.openmobster.sync.push"/>
    		</intent-filter>
    	</receiver>
```

First you setup the user initiated push notification receiver. In the action value you have to make sure its the same as the name of the unique package that identifies this application.

Next, you will setup sync initiated push notifications. There is no extra configuration to keep in mind here.
#### openmobster-app.xml ####
```
<push>
		<launch-activity-class>org.openmobster.core.mobileCloud.android_native.framework.App</launch-activity-class>
		<icon-name>push</icon-name>
	</push>
```
Here, **launch-activity-class** indicates the activity that must be launched when the user clicks on the notification from the notification bar

**icon-name** points to a drawable image that should be displayed as an icon with the notification.
