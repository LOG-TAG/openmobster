=== Introduction ===

This tutorial will cover the architectural aspects of designing a *Push Email* App. It should cover design principles that can carry over to any enterprise mobile app.


=== Getting and Running this App ===

  * Step 1: [http://openmobster.googlecode.com/svn/samples/pushmail.zip Download] or svn co http://openmobster.googlecode.com/svn/samples/pushmail

  * Step 2: Build the Code: *mvn -DskipTests install*

  * Step 3: Install the App: (*cd app-android*), (*mvn -Phot-deploy install*)

  * Step 4: Run the Cloud Server: (*cd cloud*), (*mvn -PrunCloud integration-test*)


=== Architecting Cloud Components ===

Before architecting any Mobile App it is important to design the domain model of the system. In the case of a Push Email app, this model consists
of one entity which is *Email*.

Such is the case with any Enterprise App, but in the case of a mobile app
you must also take into account the model design based on integration with a *Sync Engine*. The *Sync Engine* will have serialization needs that must be met by the entities in your domain model.

The OpenMobster sync engine is *POJO-oriented*.
