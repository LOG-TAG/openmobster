#summary Inter-App Communication

=== Introduction ===

This tutorial covers the mechanism for performing Inter-App Communication. It comes with two apps. A client app that makes the request and a service app that processes the request and sends a response back.


==== Step 1: Create the Service ====
You must create a service that will be bound to before invocation. The service must return an *IBinder* object during the *onBind* invocation
{{{
public class RemoteService extends Service
{
	private Messenger messenger; //receives remote invocations
	
	@Override
	public IBinder onBind(Intent intent) 
	{
		if(this.messenger == null)
		{
			synchronized(RemoteService.class)
			{
				if(this.messenger == null)
				{
					this.messenger = new Messenger(new IncomingHandler());
				}
			}
		}
		//Return the proper IBinder instance
		return this.messenger.getBinder();
	}
}}} 

The service uses a *Messenger* and sends it binder back. A *Messenger* is the component that makes inter process communication possible.
