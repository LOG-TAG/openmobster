==== Introduction ====
This guide is designed to help you write your first iOS application. At the end of the guide you will get a idea of how the different parts of an iOS application come together to form an App.

==== XCode ====
Before you can write any code, you need to install the development ide called XCode and the SDKs that let you develop iOS apps. You can download the IDE+SDKs from http://developer.apple.com for free.

The version of XCode I am using is 4.0.2 with iOS SDK 4.3.

==== Getting Started ====
Before getting into the coding, it is important to understand the task at a high level. If we were to dissect an iOS App, it really boils down to two main tasks

  * Developing/Laying out the UI components using a tool called Interface Builder

  * Connecting these UI components to Controllers so that you can respond to user interaction

==== Interface Builder ====
In this App we will layout the UI components using Interface Builder. Interface Builder is a GUI development tool that lets you build out your GUI visually.

When you start Interface Builder you will see the following four items:

  * File's Owner: An instance of UIApplication. The event queue for your App is managed by this object

  * First Responder: No idea. Never used it. 

  * Your App's Delegate: The Controller for this GUI. You will write your code within this component

  * Window: The window of the App. You will add UI components to this window
