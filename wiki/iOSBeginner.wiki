==== Introduction ====
This guide is designed to help you write your first iOS application. At the end of the guide you will get a idea of how the different parts of an iOS application come together to form an App.

==== XCode ====
Before you can write any code, you need to install the development ide called XCode and the SDKs that let you develop iOS apps. You can download the IDE+SDKs from http://developer.apple.com for free.

The version of XCode I am using is 4.0.2 with iOS SDK 4.3.

==== Getting Started ====
Before getting into the coding, it is important to understand the task at a high level. If we were to dissect an iOS App, it really boils down to two main tasks

  * Developing/Laying out the UI components using a tool called Interface Builder

  * Connecting these UI components to Controllers so that you can respond to user interaction

==== Interface Builder ====
In this App we will layout the UI components using Interface Builder. Interface Builder is a GUI development tool that lets you build out your GUI visually.

When you start Interface Builder you will see the following four items:

  * *File's Owner*: An instance of UIApplication. The event queue for your App is managed by this object

  * *First Responder*: No idea. Never used it. 

  * *Your App's Delegate*: The Controller for this GUI. You will write your code within this component

  * *Window*: The window of the App. You will add UI components to this window

In this App you add two Labels and two Buttons to the window. Towards the top of the window there will be a Label and a Button. This widget will flip through mobile operating systems in the market. Towards the bottom of the window we will add another Label and a Button. This widget flips through the desktop operating systems in the market.

==== Adding a Label ====
From the Object Library, select a Label and drag it on to the window. You can adjust the size of the Label as well.

==== Adding a Button ====
From the Object Library, select a Button and drag it on to the window. You can adjust the size of the Button. First button make the value, *Next Mobile OS*, Second button make the value, *Next Desktop OS*.

==== Prepare the App Delegate (Controller) ====
You can connect the above components to the App Delegate. In order to connect the components you have to expose them to Interface Builder. You App Delegate should have the following code:
{{{
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

@interface HelloWorldAppDelegate : NSObject <UIApplicationDelegate> 
{
    @private
    
    //The view objects
    UILabel *mobileos;
    UILabel *desktopos;
    
    //The model objects
    NSMutableArray *mobile;
    NSMutableArray *desktop;
    int mobilePtr;
    int desktopPtr;
}

//The Labels are wired up to instances in the controller here
@property (nonatomic,retain) IBOutlet UIWindow *window;
@property (nonatomic,retain) IBOutlet UILabel *mobileos;
@property (nonatomic,retain) IBOutlet UILabel *desktopos;

//These hold the data to be used in the App
@property (nonatomic,retain) NSMutableArray *mobile;
@property (nonatomic,retain) NSMutableArray *desktop;

//Buttons are wired to these methods
-(IBAction)nextMobileOs:(id)sender;
-(IBAction)nextDesktopOs:(id)sender;

@end
}}}
