In this article we will dissect a Titanium/OpenMobster Cloud App. The focus will be more on the Titanium layer and not on the Cloud artifacts. Before you can start exploring the app make sure you import the app into [http://www.appcelerator.com/products/download/ Titanium Studio].

The App is located under *Titanium/crud/titanium_portable_app*.

{{{
//Cloud Module
	var cloudModule = require('org.openmobster.cloud');

The *require* command is used to load the OpenMobster Cloud Module. The *sync* method provides the sync component that handles all sync related requests.
