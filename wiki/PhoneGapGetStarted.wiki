#summary Get Started: PhoneGap Sync Plugin

=== Introduction ===

[http://www.phonegap.com PhoneGap] is an HTML5 app platform that allows you to author native applications with web technologies and get access to APIs and app stores. *PhoneGap* leverages web technologies developers already know best... HTML and JavaScript. Starting with *OpenMobster 2.2-M8*, you can write offline web apps with synchronization of data using the *OpenMobster Sync Plugin* for PhoneGap. The Sync Plugin exposes the native Sync service to the JavaScript layer using the PhoneGap bridge technology. The rest of this chapter will discuss how to use the Sync Plugin using a JQuery based sample offline application.

=== System Requirements ===

  * Java 6
  * [http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html Android SDK]
  * [http://code.google.com/p/openmobster/downloads/list OpenMobster-2.2-M8]

=== Running the Cloud Server ===
{{{
cd PhoneGap/plugin-jquery-cloud

mvn -PrunCloud integration-test
}}}

This should make the OpenMobster Cloud Server up and running for the Offline App.

=== Cloud Activation ===

For security reasons, before apps can use the OpenMobster Cloud, the device must be registered with the cloud. This is done using a CloudManager App that comes with the OpenMobster distribution.

You can locate this App in the distribution under *Android/core-runtime/CloudManager.apk*. You can install this App on the Android device or emulator using the following command:
{{{
adb install -r install CloudManager.apk
}}}

Once installed you can use the *Activate* function to register with the Cloud.
