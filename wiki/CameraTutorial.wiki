#summary Android Camera Integration

=== Introduction ===

A simple guide for integrating the Camera Hardware inside your Android App.


=== Step 1: === Create a class that extends SurfaceView and implements SurfaceHolder.Callback

Before you can integrate the Camera hardware with your Activity, you must provide a Preview screen. The camera's Preview output is supplied to this screen. The *SurfaceView* instance with a *SurfaceHolder.Callback*
implementation provides such a View
{{{
public class CameraSurfaceView extends SurfaceView implements SurfaceHolder.Callback
{
	private SurfaceHolder holder;
	private Camera camera;
	
	public CameraSurfaceView(Context context) 
	{
		super(context);
		
		//Initiate the Surface Holder properly
		this.holder = this.getHolder();
		this.holder.addCallback(this);
		this.holder.setType(SurfaceHolder.SURFACE_TYPE_PUSH_BUFFERS);
	}
}}}

===Step 2:=== In the surfaceCreated method, get an instance of the Camera
{{{
        @Override
	public void surfaceCreated(SurfaceHolder holder) 
	{
		try
		{
			//Open the Camera in preview mode
			this.camera = Camera.open();
			this.camera.setPreviewDisplay(this.holder);
		}
		catch(IOException ioe)
		{
			ioe.printStackTrace(System.out);
		}
	}
}}}
