#summary AppCreator Project Structure Explained

=== Introduction ===

AppCreator is a maven based project skeleton generator. It generates a complete OpenMobster project. The project is complete with proper dependency management so that the user does not have to manually perform these steps. This tutorial covers different aspects of AppCreator.

=== Project Layout ===
Each generated project has the following 3 maven modules:

  * app-android - Contains the App for the Android OS

  * cloud - Contains the _OpenMobster Cloud Server_ based artifacts which will be deployed on the cloud side

  * moblet - Represents a "OpenMobster Moblet" which combines both the device side and server side artifacts into one single
artifact. The moblet is deployed as a simple jar file into the "OpenMobster Cloud Server". When the moblet is deployed into the Cloud
server it is registered with the built-in App store. Once registered with the App Store, this moblet can be easily downloaded, installed, and
managed on the actual device via the "App Store" functionality under the "Cloud Manager" app
