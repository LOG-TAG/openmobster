=== Installing the Activation App ===

For security reasons, before apps can use the OpenMobster Cloud, the device must be first registered with the cloud. This is done using an Activation App that comes with the OpenMobster distribution.

==== Android Activation App ====

You can install the Android Activation App (called the CloudManager) in one of two ways. 

===== Direct Install =====

You can locate this App in the distrution under Android/core-runtime/CloudManager.apk

Installation Command:
{{{
adb install -r install CloudManager.apk
}}}

===== Over-the-Air Install =====

You can download the App from the Android browser using the following address:
{{{
http://<cloudserverip>/o/android/cloudmanager
}}}
Once downloaded, Android takes care of installing it on the device

==== iPhone Activation App ====

You can install the iPhone Activation App in two ways. By compiling it yourself or from the App Store (Still waiting approval as of this writing).

===== Compile the Activation App =====

The Activation App is located in the _iPhone_ folder of the distribution.
Before you can compile the Activation App you must make sure the *mobilecloudlib* static library is available. The *mobilecloudlib* is also present in the iPhone folder. Here are the steps for compiling ActivationApp

  * First Open *mobilecloudlib* in XCode

  * Do a *Clean All Targets*

  * Do a *Build*. In the first go it will come up with some errors. Just run the *Build* again and it will compile cleanly.

  * Open the *ActivationApp* in XCode

  * Do a *Clean All Targets*

  * Do a *Build and Run*. This will launch the ActivationApp in the Simulator. You can now activate this with the cloud and you are ready to go.
