==== Apple Provisioning ====

===== Step 1: Obtain the Application Certificate ====

In order to push via the APN service, the provider side (OpenMobster->APN connection) requires a certificate for each App registered for Push Notifications. The best instructions for doing the proper provisioning and obtaining a certificate is explained at : [http://mobiforge.com/developing/story/programming-apple-push-notification-services http://mobiforge.com/developing/story/programming-apple-push-notification-services].

===== Step 2: Getting an aps_production_identity.p12 certificate =====

Once you have downloaded the aps_production_identity.cer file from the Apple Provisioning Portal

  * Import the aps_production_identity.cer into the KeyChain. Double-clicking the file will do it

  * Select both certificate and private key (associated to the application you wish to use to send notifications) 

  * Right click, and select Export 2 elements, give a name (for example : aps_production_identity.p12) and password (for example : p@ssw0rd) and then export as p12.
