#summary Encryption Support

=== Introduction ===
With the release of 2.2-M4, a very critical feature has been added to the OpenMobster platform. This is the end-to-end encryption of locally stored data. Users can now easily mobilize their Enterprise data without worrying that it may fall into wrong hands.

=== How to enable encryption ===

By default, for performance and ease of use reasons, the system operates in non-encrypted state. To run in encrypted state the following steps need to be performed

=== Step 1: Install an Encryption Activated Cloud Manager App===
You will find this app under, *Android/core-runtime/CloudManager-Encryption.apk*

If there is an earlier non-encryption version found on the phone, make sure you fully remove it along with all its data. You can do that via : 
{{{
Settings > Applications > Manage applications > Mobile Cloud > Uninstall
}}}

You can now install the encrypted version using: 
{{{
adb install -r CloudManager-Encryption.apk
}}}

=== Step 2: Activate Encryption in your apps ===
Inorder to activate encryption in your app, you need to provide a _openmobster-app.xml_ file. File should be at the top-level. The file should look like this:
{{{
<app-conf>
	<encryption>true</encryption>
</app-conf>
}}}

Thats it. In two easy steps you can now get full encryption support for OpenMobster apps
