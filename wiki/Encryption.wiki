#summary Encryption Support

=== Introduction ===
With the release of 2.2-M4, a very critical feature has been added to the OpenMobster platform. This is the end-to-end encryption of locally stored data. Users can now easily mobilize their Enterprise data without worrying that it may fall into wrong hands.

=== How to enable encryption ===

By default, for performance and ease of use reasons, the system operates in non-encrypted state. To run in encrypted state the following steps need to be performed

=== Step 1: Install an Encryption Activated Cloud Manager App===
You will find this app under, *Android/core-runtime/CloudManager-Encryption.apk*

If there is an earlier non-encryption version found on the phone, make sure you fully remove it along with all its data. You can do that via _Settings > Applications > Manage applications > Mobile Cloud > Uninstall_

You can now install the encrypted version using: 
{{{
adb install -r CloudManager-Encryption.apk
}}}
