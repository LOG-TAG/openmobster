#summary Android Notification System

=== Introduction ===

Notifications are messages that are pushed to users telling them that something has happened. E.g. When a user receives new email, the notification system is used to notify the user. In Android, these messages popup in the status bar and optionally make a sound or vibration to get the user's attention.

==== Step 1: Get the Notification Service ====
{{{
//Get the Notification Service
NotificationManager notifier = (NotificationManager)MainActivity.this.
getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);
}}}

==== Step 2: Initialize a Notification Object ====
{{{
//Get the icon for the notification
int icon = ViewHelper.findDrawableId(MainActivity.this, "push");
Notification notification = new Notification(icon,"Simple Notification",System.currentTimeMillis());
}}}

An icon names 'push.png' is packaged under res/drawable-* folders

==== Step 3: Setup the Intent to open an Activity when clicked ====
{{{
//Setup the Intent to open this Activity when clicked
Intent toLaunch = new Intent(MainActivity.this,MainActivity.class);
PendingIntent contentIntent =
PendingIntent.getActivity(MainActivity.this, 0, toLaunch, 0);
}}}

If its is so desired that no Activity should be launched when clicking on the notification, then just send a *null* value for the Intent

==== Step 4: Set the Notification's Information ====
{{{
//Set the Notification Info
notification.setLatestEventInfo(MainActivity.this, "Hi!!", "This is a simple notification", contentIntent);
}}}

In this case, *Hi!!* is displayed in the Status Bar. *This is a simple notification* is displayed as extra content when the notification is shown in an expanded view by dragging down the status bar

==== Step 5: Setting Notification Flags ====
{{{
//Setting Notification Flags
notification.flags |= Notification.FLAG_AUTO_CANCEL;
notification.flags |= Notification.DEFAULT_SOUND;
}}}

In this case, a default system sound will be played, and the notification will be automatically cancelled.

==== Step 6: Send the notification ====
{{{
//Send the notification
notifier.notify(0x007, notification);
}}}

*0x007* is a unique id to identify this notification. This comes in handy when the same notification needs to be updated with new information instead creating a brand new notification.
