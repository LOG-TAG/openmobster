This lets you manage your devices such activation, deactivation, etc. As the software matures it may add more system level functions like remote wipe, remote lock down, etc.

##### Activate/De-Activate #####

#### Push Setup ####

This is used to configure the Apple Push Notification service. As part of the system, a security certificate has to be assigned to an application before messages can be pushed to it. You can learn more about it [here](iPhonePushSetup.md).

This is where your certificate can be uploaded and assigned to an App. Once this is successful, you can send a test push to your iPhone.
